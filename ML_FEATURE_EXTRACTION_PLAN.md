# ML Feature Extraction Plan - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline for machine learning-based regression analysis of the IBEX hardware verification testbench.

**Goal**: Extract rich features from regression test data to enable ML models for test prioritization, failure prediction, and regression optimization.

## What Was Created

### 1. Feature Extractor (`feature_extractor.py`)

**Purpose**: Augment coverage labels with additional features from test execution data.

**Input**:
- `coverage_labels.jsonl` (from `coverage_labeler.py`)
- Test metadata pickles (TestRunResult objects)
- Simulation logs
- Trace CSV files

**Output**: Enhanced JSONL with 40+ features per test

**Features Extracted**:
- **Test Metadata** (10 features): pass/fail, test type, seed, simulator, configuration
- **Execution Features** (15 features): instruction counts, cycle counts, exceptions, log metrics
- **Trace Features** (8 features): instruction mix, unique PCs, branch/load/store counts
- **Derived Features** (10 features): instruction ratios, control flow complexity, CPI, exception rate

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 feature_extractor.py \
  --input coverage_labels.jsonl \
  --output enhanced_features.jsonl \
  --metadata ibex/dv/uvm/core_ibex/out/metadata \
  --verbose
```

### 2. Feature Analyzer (`analyze_features.py`)

**Purpose**: Explore and analyze the enhanced feature dataset.

**Capabilities**:
- Compute dataset statistics (label distribution, test types, coverage stats)
- Display sample records with key features
- Export flattened feature matrix (CSV/Parquet/JSON) for ML frameworks
- Feature availability analysis

**Usage**:
```bash
# Analyze dataset
python3 analyze_features.py enhanced_features.jsonl

# Export feature matrix for ML
python3 analyze_features.py enhanced_features.jsonl \
  --export features.csv \
  --format csv
```

### 3. ML Example (`ml_example_test_prioritization.py`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate end-to-end ML pipeline for test prioritization.

**Capabilities**:
- Load and prepare features for training
- Train Random Forest classifier
- Evaluate model performance (precision, recall, ROC-AUC)
- Demonstrate test prioritization (rank tests by predicted contribution)
- Show feature importance analysis

**Usage**:
```bash
python3 ml_example_test_prioritization.py enhanced_features.jsonl \
  --train-split 0.8 \
  --top-k 20
```

  --metadata out/metadata \
  --output coverage_labels.jsonl

# Step 3: Extract additional features
python3 ../../feature_extractor.py \
  --input coverage_labels.jsonl \
  --output enhanced_features.jsonl \
  --metadata out/metadata \
  --verbose

# Step 4: Analyze feature dataset
python3 ../../analyze_features.py enhanced_features.jsonl \
  --export features.csv

# Step 5: Train ML model
python3 ../../ml_example_test_prioritization.py enhanced_features.jsonl
```

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why JSONL Format?

- **Human-readable**: Easy debugging and inspection
- **Flexible schema**: Easy to add new features
- **Tool support**: Native support in pandas, jq, etc.

### Why Separate Scripts?
- **Modularity**: Each script has single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Can run feature extraction independently
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap components
- **Testing**: Easier to test individual components

### Why Random Forest Baseline?
- **Interpretable**: Feature importance analysis
- **Robust**: Handles missing values and mixed types
- **No scaling required**: Works with raw features
- **Fast training**: Good for rapid iteration
- **Ensemble method**: Generally good performance

### Why These Features?
- **Coverage-correlated**: Instruction mix affects coverage
- **Computationally cheap**: No expensive analysis
- **Available**: Already logged/traced
- **Actionable**: Can inform test generation

## Key Design Principles

1. **Fail gracefully**: Missing data doesn't break pipeline
2. **Preserve original data**: Augment, don't replace
3. **Document everything**: Clear feature descriptions
4. **Make it actionable**: Provide concrete examples
5. **Keep it simple**: Start with simple features/models
